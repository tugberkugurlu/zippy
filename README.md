# zippy

Born out of anger and frustration. See the [wiki](https://github.com/tugberkugurlu/zippy/wiki) for current nonsense.

## What I want to do

 - Package up a zip/tar/{insert-archive-format} file and send it to an HTTP endpoint with a version information: `zippy push ./my-package-name.zip --version 1.2.3-beta.56423`
 - Be able to say `zippy get my-package-name --out ./tools/` to get the latest.
